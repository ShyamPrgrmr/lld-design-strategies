# LLD Design Strategies Code Examples

## Design Patterns : [LINK](https://github.com/ShyamPrgrmr/lld-design-strategies/tree/master/src/main/java/lld/design/patterns)

### Creational Patterns
- [x] Abstract Factory - Factory of Factories. 
- [x] Factory - Conditionally creating an object. 
- [x] Builder - buid() method to build target class. 
- [x] Singleton - Single object for entire application. 
- [x] Prototype - Creating multiple obejcts of class. 

### Structural Patterns
- [x] Decorator - Decorating Base with Toping.
- [x] Adapter - Interface to add compatibility between two incompatible objects.  
- [x] Bridge - Decoupling abstraction and implementation. 
- [x] Composite - Tree like structure. Compisite and Leaf nodes. ex. Calculator's Arithmatic Evaluation. 
- [x] Fecade - Hiding comlexity. 
- [x] Fly Weight - When we have limited Memory. 
- [x] Proxy - Proxy for object implementing same interface. 

### Behavioural Patterns
- [x] Strategy - Using strategies to avoid Class Explosion at same level.  
- [x] Observer - Observable and Observer. (notify(), add(), update(), setData()) 
- [x] Chain of responsibility - Each object has responsibility.
